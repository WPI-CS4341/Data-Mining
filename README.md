Data-Mining
===========
Data mining (decision trees + a neural network) using Python and Weka.

Todo List
===

For the whole project
---

- [ ] Program to generate features for the decision trees
      ./yourProgram  input.csv  output.csv

- [ ] Make sure your program can run correctly on the **CCC** machines.
- [ ] A **README** file providing any information to help grade and execute your program.
- [ ] A .model file which is the **decision tree** model generated in WEKA.
- [ ] A .model file which is a **neural network** model generated in WEKA.
- [ ] A member1_member2_p3_report.(doc/pdf) file containing the information outlined in the Report section below.

For the report
---
- [ ] Explain your definition of your **5+** features and why you thought they should be useful.
- [ ] Explain what you did for **testing** your **decision trees**, what sort of **cross validation** you used, the corresponding result, and the final analysis.
- [ ] Take 5-10 **screenShots** from WEKA
- [ ] what **conclusion** you draw from the screen shots.
- [ ] Tell us a little bit about the value of your different features.
- [ ] Compare a strategy of leave-one-feature-out, and a strategy of testing-each-feature-separately.
- [ ] Other feature approach
